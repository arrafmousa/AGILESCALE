#   The 'query' is the string being search.
#   'search_type' is what the query represents. If
#   'search_type' is None, then a general search is
#   performed. 'source' refers to where the search is
#   taking place. If not specified, default is 'chemspider'.
#   'mass_plus_minus' refers to a molecular weight/mass
#   search on ChemSpider, wherein the weight/mass is within
#   that range. It must be a number data type, as strings
#   will not be parsed correctly.
